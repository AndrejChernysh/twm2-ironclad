While the soldiers battle their faction's physical threats, these are the men who form your front line against the perils of heresy, and can actually denounce witches and heretics that stalk the land - this is the perfect way to prove one's faith and conviction.\n{SMT_SCOUT_DESCR}DO NOT TRANSLATE: THIS TOOLTIP TEXT SHOULD NEVER APPEAR ON SCREEN!\n{SMT_ENGINEER_DESCR}DO NOT TRANSLATE: THIS TOOLTIP TEXT SHOULD NEVER APPEAR ON SCREEN!\n{SMT_SPY_DESCR}Spies are the eyes and ears of your faction, capable of being sent to observe foreign settlements or armies - hopefully undetected. Aside from sending intelligence on structures and inhabitants, once working inside a settlement, spies begin to stir unrest among the populace with propaganda. They may also succeed in disabling defences in a siege, which can prove utterly decisive.\n{SMT_ASSASSIN_DESCR}An assassin is the ideal man to call upon when a foreign target is either too well defended by armed forces for a frontal assault, or if you wish to strike without it being obvious that it was you that gave the order. Not only can assassins take out live targets, they can also bring down a building marked for sabotage, and can even specialise in this field of destruction.\n{SMT_DIPLOMAT_DESCR}A diplomat is a man who serves his people as a representative in negotiations. His well-spoken manner and ability to read those he deals with will come to the fore whether he is being sent to impress, flatter, bribe, threaten or barter with foreign dignitaries and officials.\n{SMT_ADMIRAL_DESCR}An admiral is naval commander who leads an entire fleet. The abilities and retinue that an admiral can develop throughout their career can improve their abilities to fight and navigate more efficiently.
